This script performs classification on the Heart Disease Dataset using Decision Tree and Random Forest models:

Loads and preprocesses the data (splitting and scaling).

Trains a Decision Tree, evaluates it, and visualizes the tree structure.

Demonstrates overfitting control using max_depth.

Trains a Random Forest, compares accuracy, and evaluates feature importance.

Uses cross-validation to assess model generalization.

Plots and saves visual outputs like the decision tree and feature importance chart.
